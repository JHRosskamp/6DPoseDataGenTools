# 6D Pose Data Generation Tools

This repository contains scripts from the paper **Effects of Markers in Training Datasets on the Accuracy of 6D Pose Estimation**.
Expected tools and scripts by January end include:

- Blenderproc scripts for synthetic data generation used in our experiments
- Scripts for marker removal in images using LaMa inpainting
